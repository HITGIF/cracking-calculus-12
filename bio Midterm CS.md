# Hydrogen Bond
 occurs whenever a covalently bonded hydrogen is positive and attracted to a negatively charged atom some distance away. (δ+/-)

# SA:V
As the size doubled, the SA:V ratio decreased by half.
Cells divide before they become too big to supply nutrients by diffusion

# Metabolism
Metabolic pathway – series of linked reactions

# Enzymes
special type of protein that function as catalysts
    reusable, unique
    
    lower activation energy by providing alternative metabolic pathway, allowing/speeding up the reaction

Active Site 
Induced Fit Model 
coenzymes: organic 
cofactors: inorganic
Vitamins: act as coenzymes
apoenzyme: the protein part of enzyme

## Factors
pH – preferred range, H-bond
Temperature - collision, optimal
Substrate concentration – limited by ->
enzyme concentration
Presence of Inhibitors

## Inhibitors
Enzyme inhibition – when an enzyme is unable to bind to its substrate
Competitive inhibition – inhibitor binds to active site
Non-competitive inhibition – the inhibitor molecule binds to allosteric site, conformational change

## Thyroxin
Hormone. Promote metabolic rate
    Speeding up protein synthesis
    Aiding in long bone growth
    Promoting proper development in the fetus
